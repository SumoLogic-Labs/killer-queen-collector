# killer-queen-collector
Standalone Scala application that connects to a Killer Queen arcade cabinet, receives game events, and turns them into 
JSON payloads to be logged and analyzed. It additionally enriches the stream of events to provide more useful metadata. 
There is also the optional ability to use a simple UI to assign player names so that you can consistently track player 
performance over time.

## Core Concepts
### Event
The core concept is that everything is an `Event`.  In code, there are a few sub types: `InboundEvent`, `OutboundEvent`, 
`GameplayEvent`, `ResetEvent`, and `EnrichedEvent`. 

- `InboundEvent` - Native events generated by the KQ cabinet and received by the collector.  For more history, see the [original reddit request thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KillerQueen/comments/82tbug/feature_request_stats/).
  - `GameplayEvent` - `InboundEvent` that involves gameplay, instead of general control flow.
- `OutboundEvent` - Events generated by the collector and sent to the KQ cabinet.
- `ResetEvent` - Internal collector control event that can be passed to `StateMachine.reset` to avoid creating an arbitrary event.
- `EnrichedEvent` - Our attempt to use knowledge of the current game's state to add contextual information to an `InboundEvent`

To know more about the types of events and the fields they have available, please check the source.  See 
[EnrichedEvents.scala](https://github.com/SumoLogic/killer-queen-collector/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/sumologic/killerqueen/model/EnrichedEvents.scala) 
and 
[Events.scala](https://github.com/SumoLogic/killer-queen-collector/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/sumologic/killerqueen/model/Events.scala).

### Player and Player State
A `Player` is a singular reference to the position on the cabinet.  i.e. Player 1 is the Gold Queen, always.

In a single play of a game, there is a `PlayerState` that can be used to track the current state of any given character. 
They have an attribute that is a `Player`.

### Additional Terminology
- A `Maiden` is the game's codified name for gates that minions can use to upgrade their player
